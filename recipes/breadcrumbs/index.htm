<p>My favorite thing about english muffins: egg + cheese
sandwiches! It's like an Egg McMuffin but homemade. You can also just lightly
toast them and top them with butter, jam or cream cheese + lox. Oh the
possibilities! But first we have to make them.</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients, it makes six.</strong> <em>Adapted from The Bread Baker's Apprentice.</em></p>

<p class="Ingredients">2 1/4 cups bread flour<br>
1/2 tablespoon sugar<br>
3/4 teaspoon salt<br>
1 tablespoon shortening (or butter at room temperature)<br>
1 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast<br>
1/4 cup warm water<br>
3/4 cup milk</p>

<p>Combine the yeast with the warm water. I like to add just a
pinch of sugar to the water before pouring in the yeast, just really get things
going.</p>

<p>In a large mixing bowl combine the flour, sugar, and salt. Stir
in the shortening, this will be a little clumpy and that's ok. Now pour in the
yeast water and milk. Stir until a dough ball forms. If you are using a stand
mixer and dough hook to knead the dough, this will take about 6 minutes until
the dough becomes elastic like. If you knead by hand it will probably take 8–10
minutes (and a lot more muscles). Place in a lightly oiled bowl, cover and
allow to rise until doubled in size (about 60–90 minutes).</p>

<p><img alt="" width="400" height="487" id="_x0000_i1064"
src="assets/Recipes-2.jpg"></p>

<p>Plop the dough out on a floured work surface. Yes, you must
plop. Divide the dough into six equal parts. The orginal recipes encourages six
muffins, although I think this could easily make eight as it yeilds pretty big
english muffins if you stick with six. </p>

<p>Anyway, roll each muffin into a ball. Place on a baking
sheet lined with parchment paper and a little bit of cornmeal (or flour).
Cover, and allow to rise for an additional hour.</p>

<p><img alt="" width="400" height="271" id="_x0000_i1063"
src="assets/Recipes-3.jpg"></p>

<p>Heat a cast iron skillet (or other oven safe pan) over
medium heat. Add a teaspoon of oil. You don't want too much as our goal isn't
to fry the dough, but we don't want it to stick to the pan either. Cook for 5–6
minutes on each side. You want each side to get very brown, but not burnt.</p>

<p>Once you've cooked each side pop the skillet in the oven at
205°C for 10–12 minutes until the english muffins are cooked through.</p>

<p>If you do not have an oven safe pan, or you don't have one
large enough for all the muffins, you can remove the muffins after cooking on
each side to the baking sheet (still lined with parchment paper and cornmeal)
and bake on there. Either way.</p>

<h2><a name="ThinCrustPizzaDough" id="ThinCrustPizzaDough"></a>Thin crust pizza dough (yeast-free!)</h2>

<p><img alt="" width="400" height="600" id="25"

<p>If you've ever seen the amazing Bill Murray movie What About
Bob?, you already know his theory of the world that claims there are only two
kinds of people in it—those who like Neil Diamond and those who don't. Well, I
don't know exactly how I feel about Neil Diamond, but that's also how I
categorize people, except I substitute ND with pizza. And even within the group
of people who like pizza, there are those who like it and those who love it. I
really love it. Actually, if I were brave enough, I would admit to you that I
had it yesterday for lunch, ate pizza rolls later as a late night snack, and
I'm having it again today for lunch. It just always sounds good!</p>

<p>I like all kinds of pizza, but thin crust has a special
place in my heart, and I wanted to find a fast and easy thin crust recipe so I
could make pizza from scratch more often. If you're wanting to cut down your
pizza dough making time, a yeast-free option is the way to go, and I tried a
few options before I found one that I think is the best.</p>

<p><strong>Thin Crust Pizza Dough (Yeast-Free), makes two 10&quot;
pizzas.</strong><br>
<em>Slightly adapted&nbsp;from&nbsp;this&nbsp;thin
crust recipe</em></p>

<p class="Ingredients">2 cups all-purpose flour<br>
1 teaspoon baking powder<br>
1/2 teaspoon salt<br>
1/2 cup water<br>
2 tablespoons olive oil</p>

<p>Mix your flour, baking powder, and salt together in a mixing
bowl. Mix your water and olive oil together in a separate small bowl and add
into the dry mixture as you stir. When it's almost combined, use your hands to
gently knead the dough together. Add small amounts of extra water if needed.
You want your dough to be dry enough that it doesn't stick to your hands, but
wet enough to stay together when you squeeze it.</p>

<p><img alt="" width="400" height="600" id="31"
src="assets/Recipes-31.jpg"></p>

<p>Once the dough is the right consistency, divide it into two
balls, cover, and let rest for 10 minutes.</p>

<p>You can roll out your dough between two sheets of wax paper,
but I actually like using a lightly floured counter instead (I think I can get
it a little thinner that way). You want to get the dough as thin as possible,
but shoot for around 1/8&quot; thick.</p>

<p><img alt="" width="400" height="600" id="34"
src="assets/Recipes-32.jpg"></p>

<p>Turn your oven to 218˚C and lightly grease a baking sheet or
pizza pan. Place the dough on the sheet and prebake your crust for about 10
minutes or until the crust just begins to brown slightly.</p>

<p><img alt="" width="400" height="600" id="37"
src="assets/Recipes-33.jpg"></p>

<p>Add your sauce, cheese, and pizza toppings, and bake your
pizza for another 10 minutes or until the cheese and crust are golden brown.
Slice and serve immediately.</p>

<p>Your crust should be thin and crispy, so adjust your
prebaking times as needed to get that perfect crunchy bite. I'm so glad to
finally have an easy and quick thin crust option available for when that pizza
craving hits. Which, as you already know, is pretty often. Are you team thin
crust or thick when it comes to pizza? (Hint: There's no wrong answer!) xo.
