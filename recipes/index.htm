<h2><a id="HomemadeEnglishMuffins"></a>Homemade English Muffins</h2>

<p><img alt="" width="400" height="604" id="_x0000_i1065"
src="Assets/Recipes-1.jpg"></p>

<p>My favorite thing about english muffins: egg + cheese
sandwiches! It's like an Egg McMuffin but homemade. You can also just lightly
toast them and top them with butter, jam or cream cheese + lox. Oh the
possibilities! But first we have to make them.</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients, it makes six.</strong> <em>Adapted from The Bread Baker's Apprentice.</em></p>

<p class="Ingredients">2 1/4 cups bread flour<br>
1/2 tablespoon sugar<br>
3/4 teaspoon salt<br>
1 tablespoon shortening (or butter at room temperature)<br>
1 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast<br>
1/4 cup warm water<br>
3/4 cup milk</p>

<p>Combine the yeast with the warm water. I like to add just a
pinch of sugar to the water before pouring in the yeast, just really get things
going.</p>

<p>In a large mixing bowl combine the flour, sugar, and salt. Stir
in the shortening, this will be a little clumpy and that's ok. Now pour in the
yeast water and milk. Stir until a dough ball forms. If you are using a stand
mixer and dough hook to knead the dough, this will take about 6 minutes until
the dough becomes elastic like. If you knead by hand it will probably take 8–10
minutes (and a lot more muscles). Place in a lightly oiled bowl, cover and
allow to rise until doubled in size (about 60–90 minutes).</p>

<p><img alt="" width="400" height="487" id="_x0000_i1064"
src="Assets/Recipes-2.jpg"></p>

<p>Plop the dough out on a floured work surface. Yes, you must
plop. Divide the dough into six equal parts. The orginal recipes encourages six
muffins, although I think this could easily make eight as it yeilds pretty big
english muffins if you stick with six. </p>

<p>Anyway, roll each muffin into a ball. Place on a baking
sheet lined with parchment paper and a little bit of cornmeal (or flour).
Cover, and allow to rise for an additional hour.</p>

<p><img alt="" width="400" height="271" id="_x0000_i1063"
src="Assets/Recipes-3.jpg"></p>

<p>Heat a cast iron skillet (or other oven safe pan) over
medium heat. Add a teaspoon of oil. You don't want too much as our goal isn't
to fry the dough, but we don't want it to stick to the pan either. Cook for 5–6
minutes on each side. You want each side to get very brown, but not burnt.</p>

<p>Once you've cooked each side pop the skillet in the oven at
205°C for 10–12 minutes until the english muffins are cooked through.</p>

<p>If you do not have an oven safe pan, or you don't have one
large enough for all the muffins, you can remove the muffins after cooking on
each side to the baking sheet (still lined with parchment paper and cornmeal)
and bake on there. Either way.</p>

<h2><a id="NoBakeCookieRecipe"></a>No-Bake Cookie Recipe</h2>

<p><img alt="" width="400" height="600" id="_x0000_i1061"
src="Assets/Recipes-5.jpg"></p>

<p>I really can't claim this is entirely MY recipe. It's really
my mom's. She makes the best no-bake cookies, as it was a childhood staple
because we would not turn on the oven during the hot summer months. But we
still needed cookies (needed? Okay, maybe just really wanted), so no-bake
cookies it was.</p>

<p>There have been a couple times this summer I've made a batch
of these and posted a photo on Instagram. I loved seeing all the comments
because it turns out these cookies go by all sorts of names. Some people call
them &quot;cow patty cookies.&quot; Which, growing up visiting my grandfather's
cattle farm often, I can see what they are saying. :) </p>

<p>And on that appetizing thought, let's make cookies!</p>

<p><img alt="" width="400" height="614" id="_x0000_i1060"
src="Assets/Recipes-6.jpg"></p>

<p><strong>Ingredients, it makes about one dozen.</strong></p>

<p class="Ingredients">1/4 cup butter<br>
1 cup sugar<br>
2 tablespoons cocoa<br>
1/8 teaspoon cinnamon (optional)<br>
1/4 cup milk<br>
1/2 cup creamy peanut butter<br>
1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br>
1 1/2 cups old fashioned oats<br>
1 tablespoon coarse grain sea salt (optional)</p>

<p>I like to already have my peanut butter and oats measured
out in separate bowls or containers. It's good to have them ready to go because
once it's time for them, you better have them ready.</p>

<p><img alt="" width="400" height="269" id="_x0000_i1059"
src="Assets/Recipes-7.jpg"></p>

<p>In a medium pot, begin melting the butter over medium heat.
Just before it's all melted, add in the milk, sugar, cocoa, and cinnamon if
using. Stir this together so it's well combined. Now turn up the heat. As soon
as the mixture comes to a boil, begin a timer (I used my phone). Allow the
mixture to cook a full minute; don't get impatient here as it needs to boil for
the full minute. </p>

<p>Turn off the heat and stir in the vanilla and peanut butter.
Once the peanut butter is mixed in, stir in the oats. Quickly plop the mixture
into small mounds on wax paper, topping with a little sea salt if using.</p>

<p><img alt="" width="400" height="600" id="_x0000_i1058"
src="Assets/Recipes-8.jpg"></p>

<p>If your batter seems too runny, before plopping the cookies
onto the wax paper, add another handful (or two) of oats and stir those in.
It's better for the mixture to be a little too runny than too dry, but once
you've made these once or twice you'll get the hang of it. They are so easy,
fast, and addictive. Enjoy! xo. Emma</p>

<p>P.S. To change up the flavor, you can add a handful of
chopped coconut flakes or nuts.</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients, it makes about twenty cupcakes</strong></p>

<p class="Ingredients">2 cups flour<br>
1/2 teaspoon salt <br>
2 teaspoons baking powder <br>
1/2 cup butter, softened <br>
3/4 cup sugar (if you like your cupcakes
very sweet, add a little more.) <br>

<h2><a id="EverythingBagels"></a>Everything bagels</h2>

<p><img width="400" height="470" id="_x0000_i1051"
src="Assets/Recipes-15.jpg" alt="Описание: Everything Bagels"></p>

<p>Elsie has been requesting bagels for a few weeks now. It's
been quite some time since I last made bagels. Here's why: they are very
addictive! My all time favorite is blueberry bagels, but a very close second is
everything bagels. :)</p>

<p><img alt="" width="400" height="267" id="_x0000_i1050"
src="Assets/Recipes-16.jpg"></p>

<p>What's sort of strange about making bagels is you have to
boil the dough before baking. This process creates a chewy interior crumb while
the outside is browned and almost crisp.</p>

<p><img alt="" width="400" height="267" id="_x0000_i1049"
src="Assets/Recipes-17.jpg"><br>
<img alt="" width="400" height="267" id="_x0000_i1048"
src="Assets/Recipes-18.jpg"></p>

<p><strong>Everything Bagels, makes eight.</strong></p>

<p class="Ingredients">1 1/4 cup warm water<br>
1 1/2 tablespoon sugar<br>
2 teaspoons (one package) active dry yeast<br>
3 1/2 cups bread flour<br>
1 1/2 teaspoons salt<br>
2 tablespoons sesame seeds (I used both black and white)<br>
2 teaspoons poppy seeds<br>
1 teaspoon caraway seeds<br>
1 teaspoon coarse grain sea salt<br>
1 egg</p>

<p>In a bowl, combine the water and sugar and stir to dissolve.
Pour in the yeast and allow this to sit for 6–8 minutes. In a larger bowl,
whisk together the flour and 1 1/2 teaspoon salt. Once the yeast mixture has
had time to activate, pour it in to the flour mixture and stir until a crumbly
dough forms. Turn out onto a floured surface and knead for 6–7 minutes until
the dough begins to become elastic-like. You can also do this in a stand mixer
with a dough hook attachment. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover
and allow to rise in a warm place for 1 hour.</p>

<p><img alt="" width="400" height="267" id="_x0000_i1047"
src="Assets/Recipes-19.jpg"></p>

<p>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and divide
into eight equal pieces. Shape into a ball and press your finger through to
form the center hole. Once you have shaped all the bagels, allow them to rest
for 10 minutes or so. Now place them into a pot of boiling water. They should
float. Let them cook for 45 seconds to 1 minute on each side, then remove to
your prepared baking sheet.</p>

<p><img alt="" width="400" height="267" id="16"
src="Assets/Recipes-20.jpg"></p>

<p>Whisk the egg plus 1 teaspoon water in a small bowl and
brush this over each bagel. Sprinkle on the seeds! The egg wash will help them
stick as well as add a pretty brown sheen to your bagels.</p>

<p><img alt="" width="400" height="267" id="19"
src="Assets/Recipes-21.jpg"></p>

<p>Eureka! After you add the seeds bake at 218°C for 20
minutes. If you don't eat them all in one day, store in an airtight container
for 4–5 days.</p>

<p><img alt="" width="400" height="267" id="22"
src="Assets/Recipes-22.jpg"></p>

<p>Serve these with cream cheese at breakfast or make a bagel
sandwich for lunch. :) Enjoy! xo. Emma</p>

<h2><a id="PieCrustCookies"></a>Pie crust cookies</h2>

<p><img alt="" width="400" height="600" id="1"
src="Assets/Recipes-23.jpg"></p>

<p>It wasn't until adulthood that I truly came to appreciate
the buttery, flaky deliciousness that is pie crust! I wish I could go back in
time and eat all of those crusts I left behind in my childhood. Though I
suppose it's not too late to make up for those lost crusts!</p>

<p>This is a super simple cookie idea that you can whip up
before entertaining guests, or you can freeze a batch so you can always have a
pie crust cookie on hand in case of emergency.&nbsp;<em>You know what I'm
talkin' 'bout.</em></p>

<p><img alt="" width="400" height="600" id="2"
src="Assets/Recipes-24.jpg"></p>

<p><strong>Thin crust ingredients</strong></p>

<p class="Ingredients">2 cups of flour<br>
dash of salt&nbsp;<br>
2/3 cup of milk<br>
1/3 cup of oil</p>

<p>Mix until blended but don't overdo it, makes a top and
bottom. Sprinkle sugar and cinnamon as desired.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies ingredients</strong></p>

<p class="Ingredients">apple butter or any pureed preserves<br>
one egg<br>
crystal sugar for sprinkling</p>

<p>Preheat oven to 190°C.</p>

<p>Roll out your pie crust and cut out circles. Gather the
scrap crust and re-roll it to the same
thickness. Try not to overwork the scrap pieces too much.</p>

<p><img alt="" width="400" height="600" id="3"
src="Assets/Recipes-25.jpg"></p>

<p>I was able to get fourteen 4&quot; circles out of two
store-bought pie crusts. I spread homemade apple butter onto 7 of the circles.
You can use any preserve you want, but if there are chunky fruit pieces in it,
you will want to puree it first. Don't overfill the circles with preserves, or
the filling will bubble up and cook over while baking.</p>

<p><img alt="" width="400" height="297" id="4"
src="Assets/Recipes-26.jpg"></p>

<p>I cut out holes into the other 7 circles using my&nbsp;fun fall-shaped mini cutters. I placed those
cut-out circles onto the apple butter circles and sealed the edges with the end
of a mixing spoon.</p>

<p><img alt="" width="400" height="600" id="5"
src="Assets/Recipes-27.jpg"></p>

<p>Beat 1 whole egg to brush over the top of each little pie
cookie. Promptly sprinkle with some crystal sugar on top and pop those puppies
in the oven!</p>

<p>I baked my cookies at 190°C for 20 minutes, but since your
cookie sizes may vary, I'd recommend setting your timer for 15 minutes and then
letting them bake until they are golden brown around the edges.</p>

<h2><a id="ThinCrustPizzaDough"></a>Thin crust pizza dough (yeast-free!)</h2>

<p><img alt="" width="400" height="600" id="25"
src="Assets/Recipes-29.jpg"></p>

<p>If you've ever seen the amazing Bill Murray movie What About
Bob?, you already know his theory of the world that claims there are only two
kinds of people in it—those who like Neil Diamond and those who don't. Well, I
don't know exactly how I feel about Neil Diamond, but that's also how I
categorize people, except I substitute ND with pizza. And even within the group
of people who like pizza, there are those who like it and those who love it. I
really love it. Actually, if I were brave enough, I would admit to you that I
had it yesterday for lunch, ate pizza rolls later as a late night snack, and
I'm having it again today for lunch. It just always sounds good!</p>

<p>I like all kinds of pizza, but thin crust has a special
place in my heart, and I wanted to find a fast and easy thin crust recipe so I
could make pizza from scratch more often. If you're wanting to cut down your
pizza dough making time, a yeast-free option is the way to go, and I tried a
few options before I found one that I think is the best.</p>

<p><img alt="" width="400" height="600" id="28"
src="Assets/Recipes-30.jpg"></p>

<p><strong>Thin Crust Pizza Dough (Yeast-Free), makes two 10&quot;
pizzas.</strong><br>
<em>Slightly adapted&nbsp;from&nbsp;this&nbsp;thin
crust recipe</em></p>

<p class="Ingredients">2 cups all-purpose flour<br>
1 teaspoon baking powder<br>
1/2 teaspoon salt<br>
1/2 cup water<br>
2 tablespoons olive oil</p>

<p>Mix your flour, baking powder, and salt together in a mixing
bowl. Mix your water and olive oil together in a separate small bowl and add
into the dry mixture as you stir. When it's almost combined, use your hands to
gently knead the dough together. Add small amounts of extra water if needed.
You want your dough to be dry enough that it doesn't stick to your hands, but
wet enough to stay together when you squeeze it.</p>

<p><img alt="" width="400" height="600" id="31"
src="Assets/Recipes-31.jpg"></p>

<p>Once the dough is the right consistency, divide it into two
balls, cover, and let rest for 10 minutes.</p>

<p>You can roll out your dough between two sheets of wax paper,
but I actually like using a lightly floured counter instead (I think I can get
it a little thinner that way). You want to get the dough as thin as possible,
but shoot for around 1/8&quot; thick.</p>

<p><img alt="" width="400" height="600" id="34"
src="Assets/Recipes-32.jpg"></p>

<p>Turn your oven to 218˚C and lightly grease a baking sheet or
pizza pan. Place the dough on the sheet and prebake your crust for about 10
minutes or until the crust just begins to brown slightly.</p>

<p><img alt="" width="400" height="600" id="37"
src="Assets/Recipes-33.jpg"></p>

<p>Add your sauce, cheese, and pizza toppings, and bake your
pizza for another 10 minutes or until the cheese and crust are golden brown.
Slice and serve immediately.</p>

<p>Your crust should be thin and crispy, so adjust your
prebaking times as needed to get that perfect crunchy bite. I'm so glad to
finally have an easy and quick thin crust option available for when that pizza
craving hits. Which, as you already know, is pretty often. Are you team thin
crust or thick when it comes to pizza? (Hint: There's no wrong answer!) xo.

<h2><a id="FiveMinuteOatmeal"></a>5 minute oatmeal</h2>

<p><img alt="" width="400" height="633" id="7"
src="Assets/Recipes-34.jpg"></p>

<p>First, let's talk flavors, and then I'll tell you three
different ways you can make lightning fast oatmeal. One flavor I'm really
digging lately is carrot cake. This is not as sweet as a piece of cake, but it
still has all the delicious flavors.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img alt="" width="400" height="622" id="10"
src="Assets/Recipes-35.jpg"></p>

<p><strong>Carrot Oatmeal, for one serving: </strong></p>

<p class="Ingredients">2/3 cup oats*, <br>
2/3 cup milk,<br>
1 teaspoon chopped pecans,<br>
1 shredded baby carrot,<br>
1 teaspoon brown sugar or maple syrup, <br>
big pinch of cinnamon, <br>
and a little pinch of nutmeg.</p>

<p>*I used old fashioned (rolled) oats in all these but you
could easily substitute with quick cooking oats if you prefer. Both work well
in this.</p>
<p><img alt="" width="400" height="610" id="8"
src="Assets/Recipes-36.jpg"></p>

<p>This one is even easier to throw together, peanut butter and
jelly oatmeal. </p>

<p><strong>PB&amp;J, for one serving: </strong></p>

<p class="Ingredients">2/3 cup oats, <br>
2/3 cup milk, <br>
1 teaspoon peanut butter or almond butter, <br>
and 1 teaspoon jam.</p>
<p><img alt="" width="400" height="619" id="9"
src="Assets/Recipes-37.jpg"></p>

<p>This is a super easy chocolate oatmeal variation. </p>

<p><strong>Chocolate Oatmeal, one serving: </strong></p>

<p class="Ingredients">2/3 cup oats, <br>
2/3 cup chocolate milk, <br>
fresh fruit or mini chocolate chips for the top.</p>

<p>The first step to any of these variations is to combine all
the ingredients except the milk. You can combine in a heat proof mug or glass
jar.</p>

<p>For the PB&amp;J oatmeal, I like to stir in the jam after
  the oats have softened, but you could do it before. It doesn't matter all that
  much. It mostly just keeps the colors brighter if you add it after.</p>

<p>There are two methods to making this just before you head
out the door. You can heat the milk on the stove top for 2–3 minutes over high
heat. I like to whisk so it gets kind of foamy, like a latte. Or you can
microwave the milk on high for 1 minute.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then pour it over the oats and cover with the jar lid or
just a piece of aluminum foil. This will trap all the heat in and help the oats
to soften quickly. Let it cool just until it's cool enough to eat. Then remove
the top and dig in.</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients. It serves two.</strong></p>

<p class="Ingredients">2 sweet potatoes<br>
1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil<br>
1 can (15 oz.) black beans<br>
2 cloves of garlic<br>
1/4 teaspoon cumin<br>
1/8 teaspoon cayenne<br>
salt + pepper</p>

<p>For garnish I highly recommend shredded cheese, sour cream
and green onions.</p>

<p>Wash and scrub the sweet potatoes. Cut in half and then lightly cut the top 1/3 of the each side into cubes. Rub with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Bake at 190°C for 45+ minutes. My potatoes were on the smaller side so 45 minutes was enough time to cook them through, but if your potatoes are larger, you may need to increase the baking time. Just check them by trying to cut through a thick part with a fork. If you can't easily cut through, keep baking.</p>

<p>Towards the last 10–15 minutes of the potatoes' baking time,
get the beans going. Mince the garlic and cook in a small pot over medium heat in 1/2 tablespoon olive oil for a minute or two. Add in the drained beans. Stir in the spices and season with a little salt and pepper. Once those are heated through, you're ready to go.</p>

<p>Serve the beans alongside the sweet potatoes. Top with
cheese, sour cream and green onion. Dig in! This is total comfort food—enjoy. xo. Emma</p>
