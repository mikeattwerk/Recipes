<h2><a id="NoBakeCookieRecipe"></a>No-Bake Cookie Recipe</h2>

<p><img alt="" width="400" height="600" id="_x0000_i1061"
src="assets/Recipes-5.jpg"></p>

<p>I really can't claim this is entirely MY recipe. It's really
my mom's. She makes the best no-bake cookies, as it was a childhood staple
because we would not turn on the oven during the hot summer months. But we
still needed cookies (needed? Okay, maybe just really wanted), so no-bake
cookies it was.</p>

<p>There have been a couple times this summer I've made a batch
of these and posted a photo on Instagram. I loved seeing all the comments
because it turns out these cookies go by all sorts of names. Some people call
them &quot;cow patty cookies.&quot; Which, growing up visiting my grandfather's
cattle farm often, I can see what they are saying. :) </p>

<p>And on that appetizing thought, let's make cookies!</p>

<p><img alt="" width="400" height="614" id="_x0000_i1060"
src="assets/Recipes-6.jpg"></p>

<p><strong>Ingredients, it makes about one dozen.</strong></p>

<p class="Ingredients">1/4 cup butter<br>
1 cup sugar<br>
2 tablespoons cocoa<br>
1/8 teaspoon cinnamon (optional)<br>
1/4 cup milk<br>
1/2 cup creamy peanut butter<br>
1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br>
1 1/2 cups old fashioned oats<br>
1 tablespoon coarse grain sea salt (optional)</p>

<p>I like to already have my peanut butter and oats measured
out in separate bowls or containers. It's good to have them ready to go because
once it's time for them, you better have them ready.</p>

<p><img alt="" width="400" height="269" id="_x0000_i1059"
src="assets/Recipes-7.jpg"></p>

<p>In a medium pot, begin melting the butter over medium heat.
Just before it's all melted, add in the milk, sugar, cocoa, and cinnamon if
using. Stir this together so it's well combined. Now turn up the heat. As soon
as the mixture comes to a boil, begin a timer (I used my phone). Allow the
mixture to cook a full minute; don't get impatient here as it needs to boil for
the full minute. </p>

<p>Turn off the heat and stir in the vanilla and peanut butter.
Once the peanut butter is mixed in, stir in the oats. Quickly plop the mixture
into small mounds on wax paper, topping with a little sea salt if using.</p>

<p><img alt="" width="400" height="600" id="_x0000_i1058"
src="assets/Recipes-8.jpg"></p>

<p>If your batter seems too runny, before plopping the cookies
onto the wax paper, add another handful (or two) of oats and stir those in.
It's better for the mixture to be a little too runny than too dry, but once
you've made these once or twice you'll get the hang of it. They are so easy,
fast, and addictive. Enjoy! xo. Emma</p>

<p>P.S. To change up the flavor, you can add a handful of
chopped coconut flakes or nuts.</p>

<p><img alt="" width="400" height="265" id="_x0000_i1057"
src="assets/Recipes-9.jpg"></p>
<p><strong>Ingredients, it makes about twenty cupcakes</strong></p>

<p class="Ingredients">2 cups flour<br>
1/2 teaspoon salt <br>

3/4 cup sugar (if you like your cupcakes
very sweet, add a little more.) <br>

(optional) </p>

<p>Preheat oven to 170°C; line muffin cups with papers.</p>

<h2><a id="EverythingBagels"></a>Everything bagels</h2>

<p><img width="400" height="470" id="_x0000_i1051"
src="assets/Recipes-15.jpg" alt="Описание: Everything Bagels"></p>

<p>Elsie has been requesting bagels for a few weeks now. It's
been quite some time since I last made bagels. Here's why: they are very
addictive! My all time favorite is blueberry bagels, but a very close second is
everything bagels. :)</p>

<p><img alt="" width="400" height="267" id="_x0000_i1050"
src="assets/Recipes-16.jpg"></p>

<p>What's sort of strange about making bagels is you have to
boil the dough before baking. This process creates a chewy interior crumb while
the outside is browned and almost crisp.</p>

<p><img alt="" width="400" height="267" id="_x0000_i1049"
src="assets/Recipes-17.jpg"><br>
<img alt="" width="400" height="267" id="_x0000_i1048"
src="assets/Recipes-18.jpg"></p>

<p><strong>Everything Bagels, makes eight.</strong></p>

<p class="Ingredients">1 1/4 cup warm water<br>
1 1/2 tablespoon sugar<br>
2 teaspoons (one package) active dry yeast<br>
3 1/2 cups bread flour<br>
1 1/2 teaspoons salt<br>
2 tablespoons sesame seeds (I used both black and white)<br>
2 teaspoons poppy seeds<br>
1 teaspoon caraway seeds<br>
1 teaspoon coarse grain sea salt<br>
1 egg</p>

<p>In a bowl, combine the water and sugar and stir to dissolve.
Pour in the yeast and allow this to sit for 6–8 minutes. In a larger bowl,
whisk together the flour and 1 1/2 teaspoon salt. Once the yeast mixture has
had time to activate, pour it in to the flour mixture and stir until a crumbly
dough forms. Turn out onto a floured surface and knead for 6–7 minutes until
the dough begins to become elastic-like. You can also do this in a stand mixer
with a dough hook attachment. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover
and allow to rise in a warm place for 1 hour.</p>

<p><img alt="" width="400" height="267" id="_x0000_i1047"
src="assets/Recipes-19.jpg"></p>

<p>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and divide
into eight equal pieces. Shape into a ball and press your finger through to
form the center hole. Once you have shaped all the bagels, allow them to rest
for 10 minutes or so. Now place them into a pot of boiling water. They should
float. Let them cook for 45 seconds to 1 minute on each side, then remove to
your prepared baking sheet.</p>

<p><img alt="" width="400" height="267" id="16"
src="assets/Recipes-20.jpg"></p>

<p>Whisk the egg plus 1 teaspoon water in a small bowl and
brush this over each bagel. Sprinkle on the seeds! The egg wash will help them
stick as well as add a pretty brown sheen to your bagels.</p>

<p><img alt="" width="400" height="267" id="19"
src="assets/Recipes-21.jpg"></p>

<p>Eureka! After you add the seeds bake at 218°C for 20
minutes. If you don't eat them all in one day, store in an airtight container
for 4–5 days.</p>

<p><img alt="" width="400" height="267" id="22"
src="assets/Recipes-22.jpg"></p>

<p>Serve these with cream cheese at breakfast or make a bagel
sandwich for lunch. :) Enjoy! xo. Emma</p>

<h2><a id="PieCrustCookies"></a>Pie crust cookies</h2>

<p><img alt="" width="400" height="600" id="1"
src="assets/Recipes-23.jpg"></p>

<p>It wasn't until adulthood that I truly came to appreciate
the buttery, flaky deliciousness that is pie crust! I wish I could go back in
time and eat all of those crusts I left behind in my childhood. Though I
suppose it's not too late to make up for those lost crusts!</p>

<p>This is a super simple cookie idea that you can whip up
before entertaining guests, or you can freeze a batch so you can always have a
pie crust cookie on hand in case of emergency.&nbsp;<em>You know what I'm
talkin' 'bout.</em></p>

<p><img alt="" width="400" height="600" id="2"
src="assets/Recipes-24.jpg"></p>

<p><strong>Thin crust ingredients</strong></p>

<p class="Ingredients">2 cups of flour<br>
dash of salt&nbsp;<br>
2/3 cup of milk<br>
1/3 cup of oil</p>

<p>Mix until blended but don't overdo it, makes a top and
bottom. Sprinkle sugar and cinnamon as desired.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies ingredients</strong></p>

<p class="Ingredients">apple butter or any pureed preserves<br>
one egg<br>
crystal sugar for sprinkling</p>

<p>Preheat oven to 190°C.</p>

<p>Roll out your pie crust and cut out circles. Gather the
scrap crust and re-roll it to the same
thickness. Try not to overwork the scrap pieces too much.</p>

<p><img alt="" width="400" height="600" id="3"
src="assets/Recipes-25.jpg"></p>

<p>I was able to get fourteen 4&quot; circles out of two
store-bought pie crusts. I spread homemade apple butter onto 7 of the circles.
You can use any preserve you want, but if there are chunky fruit pieces in it,
you will want to puree it first. Don't overfill the circles with preserves, or
the filling will bubble up and cook over while baking.</p>

<p><img alt="" width="400" height="297" id="4"
src="assets/Recipes-26.jpg"></p>

<p>I cut out holes into the other 7 circles using my&nbsp;fun fall-shaped mini cutters. I placed those
cut-out circles onto the apple butter circles and sealed the edges with the end
of a mixing spoon.</p>

<p><img alt="" width="400" height="600" id="5"
src="assets/Recipes-27.jpg"></p>

<p>Beat 1 whole egg to brush over the top of each little pie
cookie. Promptly sprinkle with some crystal sugar on top and pop those puppies
in the oven!</p>

<p>I baked my cookies at 190°C for 20 minutes, but since your
cookie sizes may vary, I'd recommend setting your timer for 15 minutes and then
letting them bake until they are golden brown around the edges.</p>
